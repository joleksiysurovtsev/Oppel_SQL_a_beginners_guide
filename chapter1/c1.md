## Understand Relational Databases

Structured Query Language (SQL) supports creating and maintaining the relational database and managing data within that
database.

Mean by the term database, at the very least, is a collection of data organized in a structured format defined by
metadata describing that structure. There are several database models for storing and managing data. Some of the most
common models include the following:

* **Hierarchical** This model has a parent–child structure similar to an inverted tree, which forms the hierarchy. Data
  is organized in _nodes_, the logical equivalent of tables in a relational database. A parent node can have many child
  nodes, but a child node can have only one parent node. Although the model has been highly implemented, it is often
  considered unsuitable for many applications because of its inflexible structure and lack of support for complex
  relationships.
* **Network** This model addresses some of the limitations of the hierarchical model. Data is organized in _record
  types_, the logical equivalent of tables in a relational database. Like the hierarchical model, the network model uses
  an inverted tree structure, but record types are organized into a set structure that relates pairs of record types
  into owners and members. Anyone record type can participate in any set with other record types in the database, which
  supports more complex queries and relationships than are possible in the hierarchical model. Still, the network model
  has its limitations, the most serious of which is complexity. In accessing the database, users must be very familiar
  with the structure and keep careful track of where they are and how they got there. It’s also difficult to change the
  structure without affecting applications that interact with the database.
* **Relational** This model addresses many of the limitations of both the hierarchical and network models. In a
  hierarchical or network database, the application relies on a defined implementation of that database, which is then
  hard-coded into the application. If you add a new attribute (data item) to the database, you must modify the
  application, even if it doesn’t use the attribute. However, a relational database is independent of the application;
  you can make non-destructive modifications to the structure without impacting the application. In addition, the
  structure of the relational database is based on the relation, or table, along with the ability to define complex
  relationships between these relations. Each relation can be accessed directly, without the cumbersome limitations of a
  hierarchical or owner/member model that requires the navigation of a complex data structure. In the following section,
  “The Relational Model,” I’ll discuss the model in more detail.

The relational model is the most extensively implemented model in modern business systems, and it is the relational
model that provides the foundation for SQL.
