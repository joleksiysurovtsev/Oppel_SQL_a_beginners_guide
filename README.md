# Part I: Relational Databases and SQL

## [Chapter 1: Introduction to Relational Databases and SQL](chapters/c1.md)

This chapter presents an overview of relational databases and the foundational relational model upon which SQL is based. Additionally, you will gain a general understanding of SQL and its connection to RDBMSs.

## [Chapter 2: Working with the SQL Environment](chapters/c2.md)

This chapter describes the components that make up the SQL environment. You’ll also be introduced to the objects that make up a schema, and you’ll learn how to create a schema within your SQL environment. You’ll also be introduced to the concept of creating a database object in an SQL implementation that supports the creation of database objects.

## Chapter 3: Creating and Altering Tables

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create SQL tables, specify column data types, create user-defined types, and specify column default values. You’ll also learn how to alter a table definition and delete that definition from your database.

## Chapter 4: Enforcing Data Integrity

This chapter explains how integrity constraints are used to enforce data integrity in your SQL tables. The chapter includes information on table-related constraints, assertions, and domain constraints. You will learn how to create NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints.

## Chapter 5: Creating SQL Views

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to add views to your SQL database. You’ll also learn how to create updateable views and how drop views from the database.

## Chapter 6: Managing Database Security

In this chapter, you’ll be introduced to the SQL security model and learn how authorization identifiers are defined within the context of a session. You’ll then learn how to create and delete roles, grant and revoke privileges, and grant and revoke roles. Part II: Data Access and Modification Part II explains how to access and modify data in an SQL database. You’ll also learn how to use predicates, functions, and value expressions to manage that data. In addition, Part II describes how to join tables and use subqueries to access data in multiple tables.

## Chapter 7: Querying SQL Data

This chapter describes the basic components of the SELECT statement and how the statement is used to retrieve data from an SQL database. You’ll learn how to define each clause that can be included in the SELECT statement and how those clauses are processed when querying a database.

## Chapter 8: Modifying SQL Data

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to modify data in an SQL database. Specifically, you’ll learn how to insert data, update data, and delete data. The chapter reviews each component of the SQL statements that allow you to perform these data modifications.

## Chapter 9: Using Predicates

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use predicates to compare SQL data, return null values, return similar values, reference additional sources of data, and quantify comparison predicates. The chapter describes the various types of predicates and shows you how they’re used to retrieve specific data from an SQL database.

## Chapter 10: Working with Functions and Value Expressions

This chapter explains how to use various types of functions and value expressions in your SQL statements. You’ll learn how to use set functions, value functions, value expressions, and special values in various clauses within an SQL statement.

## Chapter 11: Accessing Multiple Tables

This chapter describes how to join tables in order to retrieve data from those tables. You will learn how to perform basic join operations, join tables with shared column names, use the condition join, and perform union operations.

## Chapter 12: Using Subqueries to Access and Modify Data

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create subqueries that return multiple rows and others that return only one value. You’ll also learn how to use correlated subqueries and nested subqueries. In addition, you’ll learn how to use subqueries to modify data.

# Part III: Advanced Data Access

Part III introduces you to advanced data-access techniques such as SQL-invoked routines, triggers, and cursors. You’ll also learn how to manage transactions, how to access SQL data from your host program, and how to incorporate XML data into your database.

## Chapter 13: Creating SQL-Invoked Routines

This chapter describes SQL-invoked procedures and functions and how you can create them in your SQL database. You’ll learn how to define input parameters, add local variables to your routine, work with control statements, and use output parameters.

## Chapter 14: Creating SQL Triggers

This chapter introduces you to SQL triggers and explains how to create insert, update, and delete triggers in your SQL database. You’ll learn how triggers are automatically invoked and what types of actions they can take.

## Chapter 15: Using SQL Cursors

In this chapter, you’ll learn how SQL cursors are used to retrieve one row of data at a time from a result set. The chapter explains how to declare a cursor, open and close a cursor, and retrieve data from a cursor. You’ll also learn how to use positioned UPDATE and DELETE statements after you fetch a row through a cursor.

## Chapter 16: Managing SQL Transactions

In this chapter, you’ll learn how transactions are used to ensure the integrity of your SQL data. The chapter describes how to set transaction properties, start a transaction, set constraint deferability, create savepoints in a transaction, and terminate a transaction.

## Chapter 17: Accessing SQL Data from Your Host Program

This chapter describes the four methods supported by the SQL standard for accessing an SQL database. You’ll learn how to invoke SQL directly from a client application, embed SQL statements in a program, create SQL client modules, and use an SQL call-level interface to access data.

## Chapter 18: Working with XML Data

This chapter describes how XML data can be incorporated into an SQL database. You’ll learn the basics of XML, how to use the XML data type to store XML in table column values, how to write SQL/XML functions that can be used to return data from the database formatted as XML, and the SQL/XML mapping rules that describe how SQL values are translated to XML values and vice versa.
